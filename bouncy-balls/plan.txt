1. Create sphere object?
    - Sphere can call draw on the simpleModelling js file to draw.
    - Needs to store a transformation matrix that is updated during keyframe
    - needs to store position and velocity.

2. In the animate function, loop over all spheres and update the respective positions.
    - Position and velocity update will be on each individual sphere, and is a private method to that sphere.
    - Pass in the global time differential so that its consistent across all spheres.

3. need to actually figure out the dimensions of the view box because that makes no fucking sense.
